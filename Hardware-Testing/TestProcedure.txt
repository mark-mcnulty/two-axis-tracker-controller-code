Limit Switches act as a switch? Put 3.3V on one end and when hit will send 3.3V to the GPIO pin?
	Must verify
Test Hall Sensor with H7 GPIO pin and level shifter
	Must verify
Test Speed Controllers with Mains relay, direction relay, and speed pot
	Must verify

Test Procedure:
	Determine the functionality of the limit switch
	Determine limit switch voltage level and pinouts for wiring
	Test level shifter voltage output with input
	Write test program on H7 to track hall sensor data
	Verify hall sensor pinout and wiring
	Write test program on H7 to control speed controller inputs
	Verify speed controller functionality with motor - mains, speed, direction


Limit Switch Pinout:
Black&White for 1&2 lines are NC, Pink&Blue are NO

Starting from line 1, ending with line 3
1- Line 1- Blue ---- NO Switch 
2- Line 1- Pink ---- NO Switch
3- Line 1- Chassis ---- GND?? 
4- Line 2- Blue ---- NO Switch 
5- Line 2- Pink ---- NO Switch
6- Line 2- Chassis ---- GND?? 
7- Line 1- Black ---- NC Switch
8- Line 1- White ---- NC Switch
9- Line 2- Black ---- NC Switch
10- Line 2- White ---- NC Switch
11- Line 3- Blue ---- Pin 3 on connector with Blue GND wire
12- Line 3- Pink ---- Pin 1 on connector with Blue GND wire
13- Line 3- White --- Pin 2 on connector with Blue GND wire
14- Line 3- Black --- Blue GND wire from connector
15- Line 3- Chassis --- GND???
Connector without Blue GND wire:
	Red- Pin 2 connector without GND
	White- Pin 3 connector without GND
	Chassis- Pin 1 connector without GND

Level Shifter Pinout:
LV Side (3.3V):
LV-
A1-
A2-
A3-
A4-
0E-
HV Side (5V):
HV-
B1-
B2-
B3-
B4-
GND-

VCCa and VCCb both need input power for reference
Input 5V on high side, output cooresponding low side ---> 3.3V for high, 1.45V for low
	Possible to adjust low voltage threshold in the code???
